These comprehensive Mermaid diagrams provide visual representations of:

1. **Agent Processing Flows** - How each agent processes requests
2. **System Architecture** - Overall system structure and components
3. **Data Flow** - How data moves through the system
4. **State Management** - How the HSA state evolves
5. **Decision Trees** - Logic flows for tax calculations and validations
6. **Error Handling** - How errors are captured and processed
7. **Communication Patterns** - How agents communicate with each other

The diagrams make the documentation much more visual and easier to understand, showing the complex interactions between agents and the flow of data through the HSA multi-agent system.
